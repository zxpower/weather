# Console Weather Script

Nice and small utility script to get weather in console. It uses [`gomplate`](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate) and [`wttr.in`](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) to query and display the weather forecast.

## Installation

1. Install `gomplate` following those [instructions](https://docs.gomplate.ca/installing/).
2. Clone the repo and place `weather` in some directory that's on your `$PATH`.
3. By default `weather` produces weather for Riga, Latvia and Berlin Charlottenburg, Germany for 2 days, but you can edit `weather` script and change it to cities that you're interested in.
